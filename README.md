# 📈 **STOCK PRICE ANALYSIS – TIME SERIES CASE STUDY**

### 🧾Overview

This project analyzes stock market data to understand price trends, volatility, and moving averages over time.
By visualizing price fluctuations and smoothing them with moving averages, this analysis helps identify underlying trends, potential buy/sell opportunities, and long-term investment patterns.
It’s a hands-on demonstration of time series analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
Python
Libraries:
Pandas, NumPy – Data processing and analysis
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization
glob, os – File handling for multiple stock datasets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 📊 Project Workflow
 1. Data Loading & Merging
    Loaded multiple stock price CSV files using glob.
    Merged datasets into a single DataFrame for comparative analysis.
 2. Data Cleaning
    Handled missing values and formatted date columns.
    Ensured numeric consistency for Open, Close, High, and Low prices.
 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    Visualized price changes over time for each stock.
    Compared price volatility between multiple companies.
 4. Moving Average Calculation
 Calculated 7-day, 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages to:
 Smooth daily fluctuations
 Highlight long-term trends
 Assist in buy/sell decision-making

✅ Moving Averages help to:

- Remove short-term noise
- Highlight underlying price trends
- Identify entry and exit points for trading

5. Visualization
Created line plots showing:
Daily stock prices over time

### 📈 Key Insights

- The 50-day and 200-day moving averages effectively captured long-term trends.
- Short-term averages (7-day, 20-day) revealed short volatility cycles.
- Clear uptrend and downtrend patterns were identified during specific months.
- The crossover between short-term and long-term averages served as an indicator for potential buy/sell signals.
- Stocks with smoother moving averages displayed lower volatility, suggesting more stable investments.
